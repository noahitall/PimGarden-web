        <div class="content-block">
          <p>
            Welcome to PimGarden! These terms are here to clarify how you can use our app and its source code.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">1. Our Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            By using PimGarden ("the App"), you're agreeing to these simple terms. They're designed to protect both you and us, while keeping things fair and transparent.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">2. How You Can Use PimGarden</h2>
          <p>
            You're welcome to download and use the App for personal use. Additionally, since we believe in open source software:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can access our source code on <a href="https://github.com/noahitall/PimGarden">GitHub</a></li>
            <li>You're free to download, modify, and run your own version of the app using our source code</li>
            <li>You can study the code to learn from it or contribute improvements</li>
            <li>We just ask that you don't represent modified versions as the official PimGarden app</li>
            <li>Please respect the license terms included in the repository</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you're using the official app, we kindly ask you not to attempt to reverse engineer it or use it for commercial purposes without permission.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">3. Our Promises & Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            We've built PimGarden with care, but like all software, it comes "as is" without specific warranties. We're constantly improving it and appreciate your feedback to make it better!
          </p>
          <p>
            While we strive for reliability, we can't guarantee the app will always be error-free or meet your specific needs. We're not liable for any issues that might arise from using the app.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">4. Your Data & Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Your privacy matters deeply to us. PimGarden is designed to keep your data on your device. We don't collect, store, or process any of your contact information on our servers. For more details, please check our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">5. Updates & Changes</h2>
          <p>
            We might update the app or these terms occasionally to improve your experience or reflect new features. We'll make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">6. Open Source Usage</h2>
          <p>
            PimGarden's source code is available on GitHub under the terms specified in the repository. You're encouraged to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fork the repository to create your own version</li>
            <li>Modify the code to suit your needs</li>
            <li>Run your own instance of the app</li>
            <li>Contribute back to the project through pull requests</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We believe in the power of open source collaboration and welcome your involvement in making PimGarden better for everyone.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">7. Legal Framework</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by applicable laws, and any disputes will be handled through the appropriate legal channels. But before it gets to that point, we'd much rather hear from you directly so we can address any concerns.
          </p>
